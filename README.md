# A Simple Blog


## Description

Does it look good? No. Does it do everything it's supposed to do? Also no. But does it do SOME of the things it's supposed to do? Yes.

This is a simple blog, hence its name. There are no bells and whistles like "a polished UI" or "good aesthetic design" or "the ability to post and read blog entries." But what it does have is moxy! Moxy and the ability for a user to create an account and log in. 

In all seriousness, this is a beast of an assignment. With no starter code we were asked to create a Tech Blog from the ground up. I started and stopped at least seven projects, approaching it from different angles, until at last settling on doing things in a slightly less than conventional way. I built the input first and then built the user login around that. Unfortunately by the time I got the login to work the data input wasn't working any more. 

Because the bootcamp I'm doing is almost over, I really need to spend more time focusing on the four remaining assignments and the group project that are coming up. I fully plan to come back to this and fix the data input and actually put some styling to it.

## Usage

It cannot be stressed enough how important the word "simple" is in the project name.

See? Very basic. It does, however, have a functional user signup and log in.

And finally, it has a dashboard that kind of works. This will be the first feature I fix when I come back to this.



  
## Contributing

I already know this doesn't fully work. I consider it just above an MVP with the user login page.

At this point this is really still a work in progress, so I can't think of any real feedback, suggestions, or criticisms that would be helpful.
